# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
A basic neural network from scratch using numpy and basic maths. 

This is a basic project which I developed using my knowledge of Neural Networks. This project was meant to get myslef familiarized with how a neural network learns and tries to predict values. The dataset used here is the MNIST dataset, also known as the "Hello World" dataset for basics of neural networks.

The network contains 3 layers, namely the input layer (X), the hidden layer(A1) and the output layer (A2) along with the labels as mentioned in the dataset(Y).

The dataset train.csv can be downloaded from the following link-  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmgi8_9402vD6weuBSAldsZvYavUfRVl/view?usp=drive_link

Open the nn_from_scratch.ipynb to see the full implementation.
